Good Evening Ms. Vivian, We're _____ _____

For our collab project, we've thought of a way to combine Erol's photoshop skills and my web development skills. We've thought of a few ideas and E-commerce was our best option.

Our company's name is T&Eâ„¢, and this is what it looks like as you log-in to our website.

---------------------------------------
Our website has 3 pages: one about us, the creators; another for our products; and one more for the users account settings.

If you want to log-out, you may use the button over here or if you go to our accounts page, you will see another log-out button there.

products, school package, what ms wants.

These are the comment section, for the feedback of our costumers. You just put a comment, then send.

---------------------------------------
This is the account page. This is where you're going to put your personal and payment information.

*Go through each input*
Then "Save changes"

You can skip scrolling by pressing the links over here. And you can edit your profile image using this button.
